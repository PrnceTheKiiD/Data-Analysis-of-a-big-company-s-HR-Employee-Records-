   The Data was aqcuired on Kaggle this is the link: 

   The objectives of the project are to find out the:
   - Salary of each Job Title in all Departments
   - Salary of each Job Title based on Experience in Year
   - Number of Employees based on Work Mode
   - Number of Employees in each Department based on Job Title
   - Distribution of Average Salary based on Job Title
