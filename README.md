1. Project Background (& Overview)

   Multiple Airports were used as subject in this project, mainly:
   - Bloemfontein-Bram Fischer I. (BFN)
   - Cape Town International Air. (CPT)
   - George Airport (GRJ)
   - Johannesburg-OR Tambo Inter (JNB)
   - Kimberley Airport (KIM)
   - South African Airways (SA)
   The Data was aqcuired on Openflights.org and it contains flight records from each relevant airport.

   The purpose of this project is to answer these questions:
   - Which airport  has the most flight records?
   - What location has the most flights recorded from?
   - How long is duration of flight from JNB to all different locations?
   - What are the most frequent flight locations flew to from JNB?
   - How many flight records are Direct/Codeshared?
   - How many flights are Direct/Codeshared from JNB?
   - What is the distance of flight from JNB to each different locations?
   - Which are the most visited locations from all records?

   The main issue encountered in this project was the processing of the dataset as the .csv had been read in such a way that the data in some columns had gotten mixed up with data from other columns.
   The other issue that met in this project was the positioning of the axis ticks in the charts because in some of the visualisations I would work with many data points on an axis and it would become difficult to see properly.

3. Data Structure
   
   Entity Relationship Diagrams for each dataset used

4. Executive Summary
   
   Give a summary of the findings of the dashboard report, add an image of the dashboard

   Go into a deep dive for each Objective or Target Metric that gives us insight, add images of each metric's dashboard

5. Recommendations

   Give a recommendation in regards to each target metric that was analyzed, advice the business on how to improve each metric performance
